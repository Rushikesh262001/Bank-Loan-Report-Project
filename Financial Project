üè¶ Bank Loan Data Analysis and Performance Dashboard
This project presents a comprehensive Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard created using Power BI and SQL. 
The goal is to evaluate the bank's financial health, assess loan performance, and uncover key trends by providing a dynamic and insightful view of the loan portfolio data.
üéØ Project OverviewThe core of this project is to distinguish between 'Good Loans' (Fully Paid) and 'Bad Loans' (Charged Off) to calculate a crucial Bad Loan Percentage. 
The dashboard tracks key financial metrics and provides multi-dimensional analysis to help stakeholders make informed decisions regarding risk assessment and portfolio management.
‚ú® Key Features and AnalysisThe dashboard and underlying analysis provide the following critical insights:Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
Total Loan ApplicationsTotal Funded AmountTotal Received AmountAverage Interest Rate and Average DTI (Debt-to-Income)Loan Performance Metrics:
Good Loan vs. Bad Loan applications, funded amount, and received amount.Calculation of the overall Bad Loan Percentage.
Time-Series and Trend Analysis:Month-to-Date (MTD) analysis for all primary KPIs, 
including growth metrics (MTD vs. PMTD - Previous Month to Date).Monthly Trend analysis of applications, funded amount, and received amount.
Segmentation Analysis:
Detailed breakdowns of loan metrics by key borrower and loan characteristics:
